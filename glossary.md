## Abandoned
Definition depends on jurisdiction. In Canada, abandoned wells have been plugged but where the site has not been fully reclaimed (similar to a plugged well in the United States). In the U.S., abandoned wells are unproductive wells with a known operator but are often confused with orphaned wells. Due to the confusion and multiple definitions, we recommend avoiding use of the term 'abandoned' unless in a specific regulatory context.

The chemical reaction where a hydrocarbon reacts with oxygen to create heat and oxides such as carbon dioxide and water. Energy is obtained from fossil fuels through combustion of the fuel.

## Combustion Efficiency
How efficiently a piece of equipment is burning a fuel. Combustion efficiency is an important consideration when estimating emissions, since combustion of natural gas destroys methane and creates carbon dioxide, which has a lower greenhouse potential. Higher combustion efficiencies will result in a higher degree of methane destruction and lower overall carbon intensity.

## Combustion Slip

## Emission Trading System (ETS)
Market-based instruments that create incentives to reduce emissions where these are most cost-effective. In most regulatory trading systems, the government sets an emissions cap in one or more sectors, and the entities that are covered are allowed to trade emissions permits. Rapid growth of voluntary ETSs is also underway.

## Emissions Inventory
A list of air pollutants discharged into the atmosphere over a period, typically a year. Inventories can exist for a variety of entities, including companies, industry groups (e.g., OGCI, ONE Future), basins, and countries. Inventories are often broken into source categories, which may be general (e.g., venting versus fugitives) or granular (e.g., high-bleed versus low-bleed pneumatics).

## Engineering Solution

## Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
A United States government agency whose work it is to improve society’s understanding of climate change and its impacts on human health and the environment. The data, tools, and resources that EPA develops can also be used by other agencies, organizations, states, tribes, and communities to help tackle the climate crisis effectively, equitably, and sustainably.

## Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)
Refers to a collection of corporate performance evaluation criteria that assess the robustness of a company’s governance mechanisms and its ability to effectively manage its environmental and social impacts. Examples of ESG data include the quantification of a company’s carbon emissions, water consumption or customer privacy breaches. Institutional investors, stock exchanges and boards increasingly use sustainability and social responsibility disclosure information to explore the relationship between a company’s management of ESG risk factors and its business performance.

This plan includes the systematic detection and repair of leaks, malfunctioning equipment, and surface casing vent flows. Detection of these leaks relies on regular surveys or screenings of sites for fugitive emissions. The term FEMP is characteristic of Western Canada. In the U.S. and elsewhere, the term 'LDAR Program' is often used.

## Gas Capture

## Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
A gas that traps heat in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases.

## GHG Protocol
An emissions quantification framework that is widely used by businesses, industry associations, NGOs, and other organizations. Some initiatives use the GHG Protocol for their emissions quantification requirements. GHG Protocol has published several standards but is recognized for these two emission quantification guidelines: (1) Corporate Standard – for scope 1, 2, and energy-related scope 3, and (2) Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard – for life-cycle emissions, both upstream and downstream.

## Global Warming Potential (GWP)
GWP was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). The larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms the Earth compared to CO2 over that time period. Because different GHGs break down in the atmosphere at different rates, the time period frequently used to calculate GWPs is 100 years. GWPs provide a common unit of measure, which allows analysts to add up emissions of different gases, and helps policymakers devise strategies to reduce emissions.

## Handheld Instrument

A methane monitoring method must clearly state any mandatory actions to be performed as part of the work practice, along with suitable operating conditions for the technology. These can include environmental conditions, limitations on facility types, technology configurations, and survey procedure (i.e., LDAR method).

## Methane Monitoring Technology
The process for identifying leaking equipment and conducting repairs. Includes the systematic implementation of one or more methane detection methods across a collection of assets. The program includes the method, or combination of methods, to be used for each facility, along with survey frequency, repair response, and reporting requirements. Regulations often mandate LDAR, and components subject to LDAR must be monitored at specified, regular intervals.

## Midstream
The segment in the oil and gas value chain that falls between upstream and downstream. Activities include transmission and storage.

## Minimum Detection Limit (MDL)
The smallest atmospheric concentration or emission rate that a measurement method is capable of discerning. Probability of detection is a preferred concept because sensitivity depends on context and detection is more likely under a range of favorable conditions.

## Mitigation

Pneumatic instruments are often designed to vent gas with every cycle of their operation, referred to as "bleeding".

## Pneumatic Pump
Pneumatic pumps are a type of pneumatic instrument. They are used to inject chemicals (such as methanol) into wells and pipelines, or circulate fluids.

## Pressure Relief Valve
A pressure relief valve (PRV) is a safety mechanism used to help regulate the pressure in a system. Pressure relief valves are a leading cause of emissions from hydrocarbon storage tanks. As the pressure in these tanks rises, the valve may open, releasing pressure, and in turn, releasing natural gas into the atmosphere. In this sense, PRVs are a source of venting.

## Probability of Detection (PoD)
The probability that a measurement method will successfully detect the presence of a target species such as methane gas in the atmosphere. It is typically depicted as a sigmoid curve where PoD is a function of emission rate. More complex PoD functions may consider other variables relevant for the measurement method (e.g., wind speed).

## Quantification
A general term for quantifying emissions. It is often used interchangeably with emission rate estimation, but measuring mixing ratios of a pollutant is also a form of quantification.

## Reclaimed
A site that has been fully reclaimed, including any wells plugged, topsoil replaced if needed, and vegetation re-established.

## Remediation
The process by which soil contaminants are managed and removed, and the site is readied for reclamation. In Alberta, this is done following AER and AEP requirements. Contaminated soil may be hauled to a landfill and then replaced with clean soil, or may be treated onsite until it meets AEP guidelines.

## Routine Venting
Routine venting refers to the intentional release of natural gas into the atmosphere from oil and natural gas equipment. This equipment includes (but is not limited to): pneumatic devices, glycol dehydrators, compressor seals, casing vents, and atmospheric tanks.

## Scope 1, 2, and 3 Emissions
Scope 1 or direct emissions are those emissions arising from sources owned or controlled by an organization within a defined boundary. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy, from a utility provider. Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions – not included in scope 2 – that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including both upstream and downstream emissions.

## Screening
Screening methods are used to rapidly flag high-emitting sites to direct close-range follow-up source diagnosis and root cause analysis. An example of a common screening method is an aerial monitoring campaign.

## Separator
Vessel used for separating a well stream into gaseous and liquid components.

## Super-emitter
An uncharacteristically large point source of methane. Given that most methane emissions distributions are heavily skewed, a small number of super-emitters can account for the majority of aggregate emissions across the supply chain. Emissions distributions vary widely by basin and production type, so there is debate over what constitutes a super-emitter. Highwood defines a super-emitter as any emission with mass flux rate that exceeds 100 kg/h methane and an ultra-emitter as any source above 1000 kg/h.

## Surface Casing Vent Flow (SCVF)
A condition where fluid or gas is flowing from the surface casing vent assembly. This term is typically used in conjunction with land wells.

## Suspended
An inactive site that may be brought back online (i.e., it is not plugged).

## Thief Hatch
An aperture in a tank or vessel that may be open or closed. They are typically used on low pressure tanks. Thief hatches that have been left open can be a significant source of fugitive emissions.

## Top-down Measurements
An emissions measurement that aggregates multiple potential sources into a single estimate. Top-down measurements may be equipment scale (consisting of multiple components), site level (consisting of all equipment groups on site), or regional (consisting of all sites in a measurement area).

## Transmission
Natural gas transmission systems move natural gas from upstream gathering, processing, or storage facilities to distribution systems, large-volume customers, or other storage/processing facilities.

## Transparency

## Unconventional Oil and Gas
Unconventional resources are hydrocarbon-bearing units where the permeability and porosity are so low that the resource cannot be extracted economically through a vertical well bore and instead required a horizontal well bore followed by multistage hydraulic fracturing to achieve economic production.

## Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
A flying vehicle with no human on board, either automated or remotely operated (see drone).

## Upstream
The first segment in the oil and gas value chain, consisting of exploration and production processes. Activities include drilling, production, and processing.

## Vapor Recovery Unit (VRU)
A system composed of a scrubber, a compressor, and a switch. Its main purpose is to recover vapors formed inside completely sealed crude oil or condensate tanks. The switch detects pressure variations inside the tanks and turns the compressor on and off. The vapors are sucked through a scrubber, where the liquid trapped is returned to the liquid pipeline system or to the tanks, and the vapor recovered is pumped into gas lines.

## Vented Emissions
The direct release of unburned natural gas or other hydrocarbon vapors into the atmosphere. Unlike fugitive emissions, vented emissions occur by design.
